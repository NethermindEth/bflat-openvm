# bflat-openvm

[![Nethermind.OpenVM.Runtime](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Nethermind.OpenVM.Runtime)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nethermind.OpenVM.Runtime)

OpenVM bindings for [bflat-riscv64](https://github.com/NethermindEth/bflat-riscv64)
guests built with `--libc openvm`, providing the native half of
[Nethermind.Zkvm.Abstractions](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Nethermind.Zkvm.Abstractions).

## What this is

`libopenvm.a` — the native half of the eth-act zkVM standards for an OpenVM
guest, in three layers:

1. **`openvm-accelerators`**, OpenVM's own implementation of the
   [C interface for cryptographic accelerators](https://github.com/eth-act/zkvm-standards/tree/main/standards/c-interface-accelerators),
   from [axiom-crypto/openvm-eth](https://github.com/axiom-crypto/openvm-eth).
   All 19 entry points, host-tested upstream, and the same code ere-guests'
   OpenVM guest is built on. We reimplement none of it.
2. **`src/accel-rs`**, the staticlib wrapper, which supplies the three things
   that crate leaves to the program: the curve and modulus registration
   (`src/init.rs`), the
   [IO interface](https://github.com/eth-act/zkvm-standards/tree/main/standards/io-interface)
   (`src/io.rs`), and the `__sync_*` builtins an rv64im target needs and no
   toolchain provides (`src/sync.rs`).
3. **`src/openvm_intrinsics`**, one instruction per accelerated primitive, for
   code that wants a permutation or a 256-bit ALU op directly rather than
   through the standard. OpenVM has no syscalls: each primitive is a custom
   instruction under RISC-V custom-0 (`0x0b`) or custom-1 (`0x2b`).

Dependencies are pinned to `develop-v2.1.0`, OpenVM's live RV64 line — not
`develop-v2.1.0-rv64` (an older snapshot of the same work) and not `main`,
which is still RV32 and rejects a 64-bit ELF outright.

## Usage

```console
$ bflat build app.cs --os linux --arch riscv64 --libc openvm \
      --extlib path/to/libopenvm.bflat.manifest
```

## Building

```console
$ ./build/build.sh
```

Needs `binutils-riscv64-linux-gnu` and a nightly Rust toolchain with
`rust-src`: the accelerators are built for a custom bare-metal target that
ships no prebuilt `core`, so `-Z build-std` is required. The cross-tool names
are all overridable (`AS`, `AR`, `RANLIB`, `OBJCOPY`, `OBJDUMP`, `NM`) for
hosts that spell them differently.

## Coverage

All 19 accelerators, plus both IO entry points:

| Entry points | Implementation |
|---|---|
| `zkvm_keccak256`, `zkvm_sha256` | OpenVM's keccak and sha2 extensions |
| `zkvm_secp256k1_verify`, `zkvm_secp256k1_ecrecover`, `zkvm_secp256r1_verify` | the accelerated `k256` / `p256` |
| `zkvm_bn254_g1_add`, `zkvm_bn254_g1_mul`, `zkvm_bn254_pairing` | the pairing extension |
| `zkvm_bls12_g1_add`, `g1_msm`, `g2_add`, `g2_msm`, `pairing`, `map_fp_to_g1`, `map_fp2_to_g2` | the pairing extension |
| `zkvm_kzg_point_eval` | `openvm-kzg` |
| `zkvm_modexp` | accelerated for a BN254-Fr modulus, `aurora-engine-modexp` otherwise |
| `zkvm_ripemd160`, `zkvm_blake2f` | software — OpenVM has no extension for either, on any branch |
| `read_input`, `write_output` | `src/io.rs` |

`build/build.sh` fails if any of those is missing from the archive, and counts
custom-0 and custom-1 instructions to catch a silent fallback to portable Rust.
CI then links a real bflat guest that calls all 21 through direct P/Invoke
(`tests/integration/guest.cs`) — which is what proves the symbols not only
exist but survive a guest's link.

## The output window is 32 bytes

`write_output` appends, and multiple calls concatenate, as the standard
requires — but only up to 32 bytes, past which it panics rather than drop
bytes. That is a property of the target, not a policy choice: OpenVM's public
output is a byte-addressed buffer written a `u64` at a time, and only the first
32 bytes are guaranteed to exist. ere-guests' OpenVM platform takes the same
limit and asserts on anything longer. A guest with more to publish should
publish a hash of it, which is what OpenVM recommends regardless.

## Why the curves need an explicit init

OpenVM's algebra, ecc and pairing extensions split each accelerated operation
in two: the library declares it as an `extern "C"` symbol, and the *program*
defines it by naming the concrete moduli, complex extensions and curves it uses
— what `cargo openvm` generates as `openvm_init.rs` for a Rust guest. Our guest
is C#, and this staticlib is the only Rust in the link, so that declaration
lives in `src/accel-rs/src/init.rs`. It is the same list, in the same order, as
ere-guests generates for its OpenVM Ethereum guest; the order is part of the
ABI, because `complex_init!` addresses its base field by index into it.

Without it everything still compiles, but every `sw_add_ne_extern_func_*` and
`moduli_setup_extern_func_*` stays undefined and not one custom-1 instruction
is emitted — the curve work would quietly fall back to portable Rust.

## Everything outside the interface is localized

The archive would otherwise export far more than it means to. The accelerated
curves drag in OpenVM's guest runtime (`_start`, `mem*`, `sys_alloc_aligned`),
and `-Z build-std` compiles `compiler_builtins` for a target with no libm, so
it exports the entire C math surface as well. Every one of those collides with
the guest: musl owns the math surface and `mem*`,
`modules/zkvm_openvm/module.S` owns `_start`, and bflat's `rust_sys` module
wraps `sys_alloc_aligned` so OpenVM's bump allocator draws from pal's heap
instead of opening a second one.

So `build/build.sh` localizes everything outside an explicit allowlist. A
duplicate-symbol error is the good outcome here; the bad one is this archive
silently winning over the math surface bflat's `nofp` module is meant to
divert.

## Atomics

OpenVM decodes RV64IM, so there is no `lr`/`sc`/`amo*` for LLVM to lower an
atomic to. The target spec carries `+forced-atomics`, which turns atomic loads
and stores into plain ones plus a `fence` (OpenVM's decoder accepts `fence`; it
rejects `fence.i`), and everything it cannot inline becomes a `__sync_*` call.
`compiler_builtins` implements those only for ARM Thumb, so `src/sync.rs`
provides them: deliberately non-atomic, because an OpenVM guest is single-hart
with no interrupts and no way to create a thread, which makes a plain
load-compare-store indistinguishable from the atomic sequence. CI asserts the
linked image contains no A-extension instruction.

## Constraints

**Every pointer passed to the raw intrinsics must be 8-byte aligned.** OpenVM's
own Rust wrappers spend most of their body bouncing unaligned buffers through a
temporary; these shims do not, which is what keeps each primitive at one
instruction. The standard's entry points stage caller buffers through aligned
locals, so this applies only to `src/openvm_intrinsics` used directly.

**`zkvm_keccak_xorin` absorbs at most 136 bytes** (`KECCAK_RATE`); a larger
length executes but fails to prove. `zkvm_keccak256` chunks for you.
